We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature or algorithm implementation
- **fix**: Bug fix or error correction
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without functional changes
- **style**: Code formatting and style changes

### Examples
```bash
feat(quantum): implement VQE-based eigenportfolio optimization

Add variational quantum eigensolver algorithm for discovering
eigenportfolios with enhanced crisis resilience. Achieves 15%
better worst-case performance than classical methods.

Closes #123

fix(optimization): resolve numerical instability in QAOA solver

The QAOA parameter optimization was failing for high-dimensional
problems due to numerical precision issues. Implemented adaptive
step sizing and improved conditioning.

perf(risk): optimize covariance matrix computation with CUDA

Implement GPU-accelerated covariance calculation achieving 10x
speedup for portfolios with 500+ assets. Memory usage reduced by 40%.

Benchmark results show consistent sub-100ms computation time.
```

## 🔄 Development Cycle

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Sync with latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Development Phase
```bash
# Make changes with frequent commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement core functionality"

# Push early and often
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Quality Checks
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
make all-checks

# Specific checks
make format          # Code formatting
make lint           # Linting and style
make type-check     # Type validation
make test           # Full test suite
make benchmark      # Performance validation
make security       # Security scanning
```

### 4. Performance Validation
```bash
# Run benchmarks and check for regression
make benchmark
python scripts/check_performance_regression.py benchmark-results.json

# Profile memory usage if needed
make memory-profile
```

### 5. Create Pull Request
- Push final changes to feature branch
- Create PR against `develop` branch
- Fill out PR template completely
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Request review from appropriate team members
