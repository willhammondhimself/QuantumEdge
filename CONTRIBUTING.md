## 📋 Code Standards

### Python Code Style
We use strict code quality standards:

```bash
# Formatting
black src/ tests/ --line-length 88
isort src/ tests/ --profile black

# Linting
flake8 src/ tests/
pylint src/ --rcfile=.pylintrc

# Type checking
mypy src/ --strict
```

### Documentation Standards
- **Docstrings**: Use NumPy-style docstrings for all public functions
- **Type Hints**: All function parameters and returns must have type hints
- **Comments**: Explain complex algorithms and mathematical concepts
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in docstrings

Example:
```python
def optimize_portfolio(
    returns: np.ndarray,
    risk_model: str = "sample_covariance",
    objective: str = "max_sharpe",
    constraints: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> PortfolioResult:
    """
    Optimize portfolio weights using quantum-inspired algorithms.
    
    This function implements variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach
    to find optimal portfolio weights that maximize risk-adjusted returns
    while maintaining robustness under adversarial market conditions.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    returns : np.ndarray, shape (n_periods, n_assets)
        Historical return matrix for portfolio assets
    risk_model : str, default="sample_covariance"
        Risk model specification ("sample_covariance", "shrinkage", "factor_model")
    objective : str, default="max_sharpe"
        Optimization objective ("max_sharpe", "min_variance", "robust_sharpe")
    constraints : Dict[str, Any], optional
        Portfolio constraints dictionary
        
    Returns
    -------
    PortfolioResult
        Optimization results containing weights, metrics, and diagnostics
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> returns = np.random.normal(0.01, 0.02, (252, 10))
    >>> result = optimize_portfolio(returns, objective="max_sharpe")
    >>> print(f"Optimal Sharpe ratio: {result.sharpe_ratio:.3f}")
    """
```

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical algorithms
- **Property-Based Tests**: Use Hypothesis for robust testing

```python
# Example test structure
def test_portfolio_optimization_basic():
    """Test basic portfolio optimization functionality."""
    # Arrange
    returns = generate_test_returns(n_assets=5, n_periods=100)
    
    # Act
    result = optimize_portfolio(returns)
    
    # Assert
    assert len(result.weights) == 5
    assert abs(result.weights.sum() - 1.0) < 1e-10
    assert result.sharpe_ratio > 0
    assert all(w >= 0 for w in result.weights)  # Long-only constraint

@pytest.mark.parametrize("n_assets", [5, 10, 50])
def test_portfolio_scaling(n_assets):
    """Test portfolio optimization scales with number of assets."""
    returns = generate_test_returns(n_assets=n_assets, n_periods=252)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    result = optimize_portfolio(returns)
    execution_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Performance requirements
    assert execution_time < 1.0  # Sub-second optimization
    assert len(result.weights) == n_assets
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# All tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Performance benchmarks
python -m benchmarks.run_all --profile
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 90% for new code
- **Critical Functions**: 100% coverage for optimization algorithms
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error handling
- **Performance**: Benchmark performance-critical functions

### Writing Good Tests
1. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should describe what is being tested
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
3. **Isolated**: Tests should not depend on each other
4. **Fast**: Unit tests should run quickly
5. **Deterministic**: Tests should produce consistent results

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Document time/space complexity
- **Numerical Stability**: Use stable algorithms and proper conditioning
- **Memory Management**: Profile memory usage for large portfolios
- **Parallelization**: Utilize multiprocessing where beneficial

### Benchmarking
Before submitting performance-related changes:

```bash
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
python -m benchmarks.run_all --output-format json

# Compare with baseline
python scripts/compare_benchmarks.py current.json baseline.json
```

### Performance Targets
- **Portfolio Optimization**: <100μs for 50 assets, <1ms for 500 assets
- **Risk Model Updates**: <10ms for covariance matrix computation
- **Backtesting**: >1000 portfolios/second for historical simulation
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB per 1000-asset portfolio
